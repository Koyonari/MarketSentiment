## Methodology

This ranking is based on sentiment analysis of recent news articles for each stock. The investment score (0-100) combines sentiment analysis with price momentum indicators. A higher score suggests a more favorable investment opportunity based on current market sentiment and momentum.

**Note**: This analysis should be used as one factor in investment decisions, not as a sole determining factor. Always conduct thorough research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.
